The "figure configuration information" structure contains the following
fields:

General parameters:

"fig"		- A figure handle to perform rendering on.
"outdir"	- The directory to write figure files to.

"fsamp"		- Time series sampling rate. Used for spectrum plots.

Spectrum plot tuning parameters [typical values in square brackets]:

"psfres"	- Frequency resolution, Hz. [20]
"psolap"	- Overlap between time and frequency bins, percent. [99]
"psleak"	- "Leakage" between bins (0.5 = Hann window, 1.0 = square).
		  [0.75]
"psylim"	- Maximum frequency plotted. [50]



Tuning time/frequency plots is a black art. A useful introduction is at:
