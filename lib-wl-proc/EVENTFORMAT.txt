Events are described by structures with the following fields. Some of these
may be omitted, depending on the function producing the event list.


Event metadata:

"sampstart":  Sample index in the original recording waveform corresponding
              to burst time 0.
"duration":   Time between nominal 50% roll-on and 50% roll-off for the burst.

"s1":         Sample index in "wave" of nominal start (time 0, 50% of roll-on).
"s2":         Sample index in "wave" of nominal stop (50% of roll-off).
"samprate":   Samples per second in the stored waveforms.

"snr":        Nominal signal-to-noise ratio for this burst, in dB.


Curve-fit parameters:

"paramtype":  Type of parameter fit performed. For now, "chirpramp".

"f1":         Burst frequency at nominal start.
"f2":         Burst frequency at nominal stop.
"a1":         Envelope amplitude at nominal start.
"a2":         Envelope amplitude at nominal stop.
"p1":         Phase at nominal start.
"p2":         Phase at nominal stop.

"rollon":     Duration of the envelope's curve-fit cosine roll-on time.
"rolloff":    Duration of the envelope's curve-fit cosine roll-off time.
"ftype":      Frequency ramp type ("linear" or "logarithmic").
"atype":      Amplitude ramp type ("linear" or "logarithmic").


Curve-fit waveform:

"times":      [1xN] array of burst sample times, relative to start time.
"wave":       [1xN] array of nominal (curve-fit) burst waveform samples.
"mag":        [1xN] array of nominal envelope magnitude samples.
"freq":       [1xN] array of nominal instantaneous frequency samples.
"phase":      [1xN] array of nominal instantaneous phase samples (in radians).


Auxiliary waveforms (optional; typically algorithm-specific):

"auxwaves":   Structure containing fields that each contain a signal.

  Signal labels are arbitrary but typically have the following forms:

  "FOOtimes":    [1xN] array with signal FOO's sample times (relative).
  "FOOwave":     [1xN] array with signal FOO's waveform samples.
  "FOOmag":      [1xN] array with signal FOO's instantaneous magnitude.
  "FOOfreq":     [1xN] array with signal FOO's instantaneous frequency.
  "FOOphase" :   [1xN] array with signal FOO's instantaneous phase.

  Field Trip waves are as follows:


Auxiliary metadata (optional; typically algorithm-specific):

"auxdata":   Structure containing algorithm-specific event metadata.

  Metadata labels are arbitrary but typically have the following form:

  "FOOstat":     Statistic "stat" for algorithm/processing step "FOO".

  Field Trip metadata is as follows:

  ft_trialstart:   Index of the trial's first sample in continuous data
                   (from the first column of ftdata.sampleinfo).
  ft_sampstart:    Index of "sampstart" in the curve-fit wave relative to
                   t=0 in the Field Trip trial.
  ft_sampend:      Index of "sampend" in the curve-fit wave relative to
                   t=0 in the Field Trip trial.
  ft_trialnum:     Field Trip trial index.
  ft_channelnum:   Field Trip channel index.
  ft_bandnum:      Band index from the list of bands supplied to
                   wlFT_doFindEventsInTrials.
  ft_bandmin:      Lower corner frequency of the band.
  ft_bandmax:      Upper corner frequency of the band.
  ft_eventnum:     Event index in the list of detected events in this trial.

  Additional metadata from Field Trip curve fits is also recorded.
