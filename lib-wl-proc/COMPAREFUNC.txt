A "comparison function" is used for determining whether two oscillatory
burst event descriptions refer to the same event or different events, and
to meansure the "distance" between oscillatory burst events in parameter
space.

The implementation of this function is arbitrary; comparison functions are
passed as "lambda functions" (functiton handles) to library functions that
need them.

An event comparison function has the form:

[ ismatch distance ] = comparefunc(evfirst, evsecond)

The value of "ismatch" should be boolean.
The value of "distance" should be a non-negative scalar.
