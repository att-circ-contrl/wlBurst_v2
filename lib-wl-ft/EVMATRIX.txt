The "event matrix" structure holds event information extracted from Field
Trip data. This data is kept in wlBurst library format, to avoid discarding
metadata and diagnostic information. This may be converted to and from
the "event FT" format, with the loss of some metadata.


An "event matrix" structure contains the following fields, which hold data
returned by "wlProc_doSegmentAndParamExtract":

- "events{bidx, tidx, cidx}" holds event lists corresponding to a given
  band, FT trial, and channel within the FT trial.

- "waves{bidx, tidx, cidx}" holds diagnostic waveform information from a
  given band, FT trial, and channel within the FT trial. This includes
  raw FT trial waveforms ("ftwave") and FT timestamps ("fttimes").

- "auxdata{bidx, tidx, cidx}" holds auxiliary diagnostic data from a given
  band, FT trial, and channel within the FT trial.


The following additional fields are also present:

- "bandinfo" is an array of structures with the following fields:
  "band" [ min max ] defines a frequency band of interest.
  "name" is a character array containing a human-readable band name.
  "label" is a character array containing a filename-safe band ID string.

- "samprate" is the sampling rate (samples per second).

- "segconfigbyband{bidx}" records segmentation algorithm information per
  "SEGCONFIG.txt".

- "paramconfigbyband{bidx}" records parameter estimation algorithm
  information per "PARAMCONFIG.txt".
