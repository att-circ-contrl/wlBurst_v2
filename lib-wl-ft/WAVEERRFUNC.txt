A "wave error function" is used for evaluating the "error" (distance) between
an event and a reference waveform. Typically this is done via time-domain
comparison between the event waveform and reference waveform, but other
approaches are possible.

The implementation of this function is arbitrary; wave error functions are
passed as "lambda functions" (function handles) to library functions that
need them.


A wave error function has the form:

error = errfunc(event, wavestruct)

The value of "error" should be a non-negative scalar.

"event" is an event record, per EVENTFORMAT.txt.
"wavestruct" is a structure containing one or more reference waveforms. This
  is typically one cell extracted from the "waves" field of an event matrix,
  per EVMATRIX.txt.


An example implementation is:

waveerrfunc_bpf = @(thisev, thiswave) ...
  wlProc_calcWaveErrorRelative( thiswave.bpfwave, thisev.sampstart, ...
    thisev.wave, thisev.s1 );
