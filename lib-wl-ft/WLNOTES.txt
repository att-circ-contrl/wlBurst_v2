In addition to the raw field trip structures, the wlFT wrapper routines
produce a "wlnotes" structure containing additional metadata. Contents
are described below.


"wlnotes.bandinfo" is an array of structures containing band definitions:

- "band" [ min max ] contains the frequency limits of the band.
- "name" is a character array containing a human-readable band name.
- "label" is a unique filename-safe character string identifying the band.


"wlnotes.wavesbybandandtrial{bidx,tidx,cidx}" is a cell array containing
structures that contain diagnostic waveforms. These waveforms are derived
from the original trial data and represent intermediate processing steps.
Different analyses will produce different sets of diagnostic waveforms.

wlBurst event records that are annotated with "context" typically have
corresponding portions of these signals in their "auxwaves" structures.
wlBurst event matrices store these in the "waves" cell array.

- "ftwave" is the original wideband trial waveform.
- "fttimes" contains original timestamps associated with "ftwave" data.

- "bpfwave" is the band-pass-filtered trial waveform.
- "bpf(mag|freq|phase)" are analytic signals derived from "bpfwave", from
  analyses that use the Hilbert transform.

- "magpower(fast|slow)" are low-pass-filtered squared magnitudes computed
  from the analytic magnitude of the signal, from analyses that use
  magnitude-based detection.

- "noisywave" is a copy of "bpfwave" with high-frequency noise added, from
  analyses that use frequency-stability detection.
- "noisy(mag|freq|phase)" are analytic signals derived from "noisywave",
  from analyses that use frequency-stability detection.
- "fvar(fast|slow)" are low-pass-filtered versions of the squared magnitude
  of the AC component of "noisyfreq". These represent the instantaneous
  variance of "noisyfreq" averaged over narrow and wide time windows.


"wlnotes.trialinfo_label" is a cell array of character arrays containing
labels for columns in the "trialinfo" metadata structure. Metadata present
depends on the analyses performed.

wlBurst event records typically store some or all of this metadata in their
"auxdata" structures (aside from curve-fit event parameters, which are
stored as top-level event record fields). wlBurst event matrices store this
in the "auxdata" cell array. In wlBurst event and event matrix structures,
the string "ft_" is prepended to the labels associated with these fields
(i.e. "ft_sampstart" in auxdata, vs "sampstart" in wlnotes).

Metadata that is always present:

- "sampstart" is a duplicate of "sampleinfo(trial,1)".
- "sampend" is a duplicate of "sampleinfo(trial,2)".
- "trialnum" is the original-data trial in which this event occurred.
- "channelnum" is the original-data channel in which this event occurred.
- "bandnum" is the index of the detection band within "bandinfo".
- "bandmin" is a duplicate of "bandinfo.band(1)".
- "bandmax" is a duplicate of "bandinfo.band(2)".
- "eventnum" is the event number within this trial, channel, and band.

Event detection metadata:

- "detthresh" is the minimum peak power or variance excursion for event
  detection, in dB.
- "trial_bpf_rms" is the RMS amplitude of the band-pass-filtered version
  of the original trial ("bpfwave" in "wavesbybandandtrial").
- "event_rms" is the RMS amplitude of the reconstructed event.
- "event_max" is the maximum absolute amplitude of the reconstructed event.

Cropped trial metadata:

- "roistart" is the first copied sample location in the un-cropped trial.
- "roistop" is the last copied sample location in the un-cropped trial.

Parameter fit metadata:

- "f1" is the curve-fit frequency at 50% roll-on.
- "f2" is the curve-fit frequency at 50% roll-off.
- "a1" is the curve-fit envelope magnitude at 50% roll-on.
- "a2" is the curve-fit envelope magnitude at 50% roll-off.
- "p1" is the curve-fit phase at 50% roll-on.
- "p2" is the curve-fit phase at 50% roll-off.
- "rollon" is the duration of roll-on, in seconds.
- "rolloff" is the duration of roll-off, in seconds.
- "duration" is the time between 50% roll-on and 50% roll-off, in seconds.


"wlnotes.segconfigbyband{bidx}" and "wlnotes.paramconfigbyband{bidx}" store
the algorithm tuning parameters used for segmentation and parameter
extraction of events in the various frequency bands, respectively.
