wlSynth_traceAddBursts() generates oscillatory bursts with randomly varied
parameters. The range of possible values for these parameters is specified
by "burst type definition" structures, with the following fields:

"rate":                   Average number of bursts per second.
"snrrange": [min max]     Signal-to-noise ratio of bursts, in dB.
"noiseband": [min max]    Frequency band in which noise power is measured.
"durrange": [min max]     Burst duration in cycles (at average frequency).
"fctrrange": [min max]    Burst nominal center frequency.
"framprange": [min max]   Ratio of ending/starting frequency.
"aramprange": [min max]   Ratio of ending/starting amplitude.

Burst events of a given type are treated as a Poisson point process with the
specified rate. For each event, parameters are chosen randomly within the
specified ranges.

SNR in decibels is drawn using a uniform distribution. All other parameters
are drawn using a log distribution (the logarithm of the parameter values
has a uniform distribution). This handles diverse scales well.
